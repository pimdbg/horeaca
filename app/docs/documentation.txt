    -Javascript launch.js its sole purpose is to launch other classes. it uses the try/catch function because not every page has the same classes
    -The updateJson.php file in /model is used to update the json ld, stored as js/schema.json. 
        Once there is an update load [ROOT]/pages/updateJson in the browser once and the file will update itself.
        The menucard items and -sections need no further manual instructions, if it the update is placed in the database.
        Other information can be found in the file itself, and can be update to the necessary standard
